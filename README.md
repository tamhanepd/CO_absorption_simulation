# CO_absorption_simulation
This repository contains code to generate a simulation for CO absorption by molecular gas clouds in a molecular disk with exponentially decreasing density profile, against a central continuum source in galaxies. The gray shaded region in the left panel is the beam size of the observation and the darker smaller shaded region is the size of the central continuum source.
